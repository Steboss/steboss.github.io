I've always been so fascinated by "time". What's time? Can we measure it? How does our brain perceive time? 
Back when I was a curly hair student at the Uni, I bumped into this book: ["Le molecole del tempo"](https://www.amazon.it/molecole-del-tempo-Viaggio-presente/dp/8833905861), "The time's molecules", written by Ludovico Giulio. It was the first tiem I had to realise that we are organisms, made of molecules, and the time perception is mainly due to chemical reactions, happening in our brains and in our eyes. What we catalouged as reality, it's the main product of a biochemical reaction, that occurs within 200ms from the stimulus, in our eyes. The same applies to time, where neural networks and synapses delays, are trying to keep us in the "now", although the "now" has already gone. 

A few years have passed, no more curly hair, and no more student. However, just a few weeks ago, I had a wonderful dream about controlling time. Thus, the question appeared again in my mind: what's time and how do we perceive it biologically? And here it comes this book ["Your mind is a machine"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Brain-Time-Machine-Neuroscience/dp/0393247945) by Dean Buonomano. Dean shows how time is a human invention - mostly referring to the consequence of Einstein's relativity, where time is mixed together with space -, and that the human brain is not a natural chronometer. 

Buonomano proposes that the brain's primary function is inference - I love this AI analogy. The brain is a sophisticated machine, that actively constructs time perception, giving us the feeling of time passing. An example that follow sis our ability to create mental time travels, imagining us in a future scenario, a quasi time-travel capacity.

From there, Dean investigates more and more fundamental questions related to the existence of time, and one of them is the existence of free will. Here, he opened an entire new world to me - I'll skip all the philosophical discussion here, but whoever is interest on Wikipedia we have good starting points: [superdeterminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism), [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism), [incompatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatibilism), [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism)[^1].



- Sam book argues for the fact that we are living biomolecules, and thatn our brain moelcular development is mainly influenced by environemntal conditions. Those conditions are strictly influencing the way we will live and act. Thus, giving Libet experiment, we're living under a determined world
