I've always been so fascinated by "time". What's time? Can we measure it? How does our brain perceive time? 
Back when I was a curly hair student at the Uni, I bumped into this book: ["Le molecole del tempo"](https://www.amazon.it/molecole-del-tempo-Viaggio-presente/dp/8833905861), "The time's molecules", written by Ludovico Giulio. It was the first tiem I had to realise that we are organisms, made of molecules, and the time perception is mainly due to chemical reactions, happening in our brains and in our eyes. What we catalouged as reality, it's the main product of a biochemical reaction, that occurs within 200ms from the stimulus, in our eyes. The same applies to time, where neural networks and synapses delays, are trying to keep us in the "now", although the "now" has already gone. 

A few years have passed, no more curly hair, and no more student. However, just a few weeks ago, I had a wonderful dream about controlling time. Thus, the question appeared again in my mind: what's time and how do we perceive it biologically? And here it comes this book ["Your mind is a machine"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Brain-Time-Machine-Neuroscience/dp/0393247945) by Dean Buonomano. Dean shows how time is a human invention - mostly referring to the consequence of Einstein's relativity, where time is mixed together with space -, and that the human brain is not a natural chronometer. 

Buonomano proposes that the brain's primary function is inference - I love this AI analogy. The brain is a sophisticated machine, that actively constructs time perception, giving us the feeling of time passing. An example that follow sis our ability to create mental time travels, imagining us in a future scenario, a quasi time-travel capacity.

From there, Dean investigates more and more fundamental questions related to the existence of time, and one of them is the existence of free will. Here, he opened an entire new world to me - I'll skip all the philosophical discussion here, but whoever is interest on Wikipedia we have good starting points: [superdeterminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism), [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism), [incompatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatibilism), [compatibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism)[^1].


The starting point, to me, is in 1985 with Libet's paper [Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious wil lin voluntary action](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00044903). Libet's experiment goal was to measure the timing of three things: the brain's preparation for an action, the person's conscious awareness of the intention to act, and the action itself. 

Participants were instructed to perform a simple, spontaneous motor action, such as flexing their wrist or a finger, at any moment they felt the urge to do so. A key instruction was to "let the urge to act appear on its own at any time without any pre-planning or concentration on when to act," to ensure the action was as spontaneous as possible. 

Electrodes were attached to the participant's scalp to record the brain's electrical activity using an electroencephalogram (EEG). Libet focused on a specific signal known as the "readiness potential" (RP), which is a build-up of brain activity that was known to precede voluntary movements.

An electromyograph (EMG) was used to record the precise moment the muscle in the forearm was activated to perform the wrist flex. This moment was used as the zero point in time to which all other events were compared. 

To time the moment of conscious intention, participants were asked to watch a specially designed clock and report the position of a dot on its face at the exact moment they first felt the "wish or urge to act". This is called W-time. USE LATEX FORMATTING HERE

Simultaneously, an electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded the electrical activity of the subjects' brains. Libet focused on a specific neural signal known as the readiness potential (RP), or Bereitschaftspotential, an established marker of brain activity that builds up in the motor cortex prior to a voluntary movement.   

When the timings were averaged over many trials, a clear sequence emerged:
- The readiness potential (RP) began to build, on average, approximately 550 milliseconds (ms) before the muscle itself moved.
- The subjects' reported W-time—the moment of conscious intention—occurred much later, at an average of only 200 ms before the movement.   
This created an undeniable temporal gap of roughly 350 ms. During this interval, the brain was already ramping up its preparation for the action, well before the subject had any conscious experience of having decided to act. The implication was profound: if a cause must precede its effect, then the conscious will could not be the cause of the brain activity that initiated the action. The decision, it seemed, was made unconsciously, with conscious awareness only appearing later as an afterthought.   

In 2008 John-Dylan Haynes and coworkers in [Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408715/) refined Libet's experiments using fMRI. By monitoring activity in the prefrontal and parietal cortex, they could predict whether a subject would press a left or right button with an accuracy of about 60%. This predictive information was present in the brain circa 7-10 seconds before the subject reported being consciously aware of their decision. While the prediction was only slightly better than chance, the immense time gap between the predictive brain signal and the conscious experience was seen as powerful evidence against the causal role of consciousness in decision-making.   



The 2019 study by Uri Maoz, Liad Mudrik, [Neural precursors of decisions that matter-an ERP study of deliberate and arbitrary choice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31642807/) and their colleagues is a pivotal piece of research in the neuroscience of free will because it directly tested whether the findings from earlier experiments, like Benjamin Libet's, apply to all types of decisions.
Here is a breakdown of the experiment and its findings based on your questions.

How the Experiment Was Run and What Instruments Were Used
The researchers designed an experiment to directly compare the brain activity behind two different types of choices: arbitrary and deliberate.   

Instruments: To measure brain activity, the researchers used an electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive method that records electrical patterns in the brain using a cap of 64 electrodes placed on the scalp. They focused on a specific EEG signal over the motor cortex known as the readiness potential (RP), which was the key signal in Libet's original studies.   

Task: Participants were asked to make choices between two non-profit organizations (NPOs). They were told that their choices could lead to a real $1,000 donation, making the decisions potentially meaningful.   

Differentiating Decision Types: The core of the experiment was how it separated "arbitrary" from "deliberate" choices :   

Deliberate Condition: In these trials, participants were told that their choice mattered. The NPO they selected would receive the full donation, while the other would receive nothing. This made the decision meaningful, consequential, and based on the participant's values.   

Arbitrary Condition: In these trials, participants were told their choice was meaningless. Regardless of which NPO they selected, both would receive an equal amount of money. This removed any reason or consequence from the decision, making it a purely spontaneous motor action, much like the wrist flexes in Libet's original experiment.   

Was the Readiness Potential "Completely Absent"?
The study's most significant finding was the stark difference in the readiness potential (RP) between the two conditions.   

In the arbitrary condition, the researchers found the classic readiness potential, just as Libet and others had before. A clear ramp-up of neural activity began well before the participant made their move.   

However, in the deliberate condition, the readiness potential was, as the authors described it, "strikingly absent". Statistical analysis showed that the RP signal in these trials was not significantly different from zero, meaning there was no detectable build-up of unconscious preparatory brain activity before these meaningful choices were made.   

How is the Absence of the RP Possible?
The absence of the readiness potential in deliberate decisions challenges the long-held interpretation that the RP is a universal sign of an unconscious decision being made by the brain before we are aware of it. The authors offer an explanation that suggests the brain may use different mechanisms for different types of choices.   

Their explanation aligns with an alternative model of the readiness potential:

The RP Reflects Neural Noise for Arbitrary Choices: The researchers argue that the RP is not a signal of a specific, unconscious decision. Instead, for arbitrary choices, it may simply reflect the random ebb and flow of background neural activity, or "neural noise". When a person is tasked with making a meaningless, spontaneous movement, the action is triggered whenever these random fluctuations happen to cross a certain threshold. The RP signal is an artifact that appears when you average these threshold-crossing moments over many trials.   

Deliberate Decisions Use a Different System: Deliberate, meaningful decisions are not driven by random fluctuations. They are based on values and reasons. The study suggests that these types of decisions are driven by different neural mechanisms, which are not reflected by the readiness potential.   

In essence, the study suggests that the entire neuroscientific argument against free will, which was built on the readiness potential, may only apply to a very narrow and artificial category of arbitrary actions.

However in 2025 Uri Maoz paper, [A multi-measurement study of the relation between deliberation and volition](https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2025/1/niaf023/8224571?login=false)  compared rewarded (meaningful) versus unrewarded (meaningless) decisions. Contrary to the 2019 findings, this research found that the rewarded decisions actually "exhibited a stronger Readiness Potential". 1  The authors of this study concluded that it is the presence of a meaningful goal, rather than the complexity of the deliberation, that makes a decision more volitional and that this is reflected in the brain's preparatory activity. 1 

I want to conclude this post with further details. My "will" of getting a more thorough understanding of free will - sorry for the joke - made me read Sam Harris' book ["Free Will?"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Will-Sam-Harris/dp/1451683405). I must agree with one important aspect in Sam's book: we are living molecules, our brain is processing chemistry all the time. Sam Harris's argument is a form of hard incompatibilism, which holds that free will is incompatible with determinism, and because determinism is true, free will does not exist. His core thesis can be broken down into a few key point.  our thoughts, intentions, and desires simply emerge in consciousness. We do not consciously will them into existence. You cannot decide what your next thought will be; it just appears, the product of background causes of which you are unaware and over which you exert no conscious control. Every choice you make is determined by a vast network of prior causes—your genes, your upbringing, your life experiences, and the physical state of your brain and the universe at that moment. To have "free will" in the way people intuitively feel they do, you would have to be the ultimate cause of your own desires and intentions, which is impossible. Harris also dismisses the idea that randomness at a quantum level could grant us free will. If your actions are the product of random quantum fluctuations, they are still not under your control. He also proposes a more rational judging system, as most of the awful cases we're dealing everyday with, are consequences of the environment people have grown with, family and people behaviours had on us. He argues that we can still hold people responsible for their actions in a practical sense. The law has always recognized that some people have diminished responsibility—due to factors like brain tumors, mental illness, or coercion—and Harris believes this logic should be extended. This avoids the consequence of fatalism.

What should we believe, I don't know.
