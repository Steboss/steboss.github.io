I've always been so fascinated by "time". What's time? Can we measure it? How does our brain perceive time? 
Back when I was a student at the Uni, I bumped into this book: ["Le molecole del tempo"](https://www.amazon.it/molecole-del-tempo-Viaggio-presente/dp/8833905861), "The time's molecules", written by Ludovico Giulio. The book simply states that we are composed of molecules, and our perception of time is primarily due to chemical reactions. Those reactions happen in our brain and in our eyes. What we catalogued as reality is the product of a biochemical reaction. Neural networks and synapses are trying to keep us in the "now", although the "now" has already gone, due to the standard biochemical reactions' time.

A few years have passed from that reading, and a few weeks ago, I had a wonderful dream about controlling time. Thus, again I was wondering: what's time, and how do we perceive it biologically? And here it comes ["Your brain is a time machine"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Brain-Time-Machine-Neuroscience/dp/0393247945) by Dean Buonomano. Dean shows how time is a human invention, that the time should be defined better, as in Einstein's relativity, and that the human brain is not a natural chronometer. 

Buonomano proposes that the brain is a predictor. **The brain is a sophisticated machine, that actively constructs time perception, giving us the feeling of time passing**. An example is our ability to create mental time travels, imagining ourselves in a future scenario ( a quasi time-travel capacity ).

From there, Dean investigates more and more into fundamental questions related to the existence of time, and one of them is the existence of free will. Here, he opened an entire new world to me[^1]. This is what I found from papers and books. 

## Towards the definition of free will

### The starting point: Benjamin Libet 

The starting point is 1985's paper by Benjamin Libet ["Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action"](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00044903). Libet's experiment goal was to measure the timing of three things: 
1. the brain's preparation for an action, 
2. the person's conscious awareness of the intention to act, 
3. and the action itself. 

Participants were instructed to perform a simple, spontaneous motor action, such as flexing their wrist, at any moment they felt to do so. **A key instruction was to "let the urge to act appear on its own at any time without any pre-planning or concentration on when to act", to ensure the action was as spontaneous as possible**. Electrodes were attached to the participant's scalp to record the brain's electrical activity using an electroencephalogram (EEG). Libet focused on a specific signal known as the "readiness potential" (RP), which is a build-up of brain activity that was known to precede voluntary movements. An electromyograph (EMG) was used to record the precise moment the muscle in the forearm, activated to perform the wrist flex. This moment was used as the zero point in time to which all other events were compared. To time the moment of conscious intention, participants were asked to watch a specially designed clock and report the position of a dot on its face at the exact moment they first felt the "wish or urge to act". This is called _W-time_.

When the timings were averaged over many trials, a clear sequence emerged:
- **The readiness potential (RP) began to build, on average, approximately 550 _ms_ before the muscle itself moved.**
- **The subjects'reported _W-time_ much later, at an average of only 200 _ms_ before the movement**.   
This created an undeniable temporal gap of roughly 350 ms. During this interval, the brain was already ramping up its preparation for the action, well before the subject had any conscious experience of having decided to act. The implication was profound: if a cause must precede its effect, then the conscious will could not be the cause of the brain activity that initiated the action. **The decision, it seemed, was made unconsciously, with conscious awareness only appearing later as an afterthought.**  

### Further proofs: Does the unconscious brain lead all our decisions? 


In 2008, John-Dylan Haynes and coworkers in [Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408715/) refined Libet's experiments using fMRI. By monitoring activity in the prefrontal and parietal cortex, they could predict whether a subject would press a left or right button with an accuracy of about 60%. This predictive information was present in the brain about 7-10 seconds before the subject reported being consciously aware of their decision. While the prediction was only slightly better than chance, **the immense time gap between the predictive brain signal and the conscious experience was seen as powerful evidence against the causal role of consciousness in decision-making.** 

### Arbitrary decisions vs deliberate decisions: a "hope" for free will


The 2019 study by Uri Maoz, Liad Mudrik and coworkers, in [Neural precursors of decisions that matter-an ERP study of deliberate and arbitrary choice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31642807/) and their colleagues tested whether the findings from earlier experiments, like Libet's experiment, apply to all types of decisions. Participants were asked to make choices between two non-profit organizations (NPOs). They were told that their choices could lead to a real $1'000 donation, making the decisions potentially meaningful. The core of the experiment was how it separated "arbitrary" from "deliberate" choices:
- Deliberate Condition: In these trials, participants were told that their choice mattered. The NPO they selected would receive the full donation, while the other would receive nothing. This made the decision meaningful, consequential, and based on the participant's values.   
- Arbitrary Condition: In these trials, participants were told their choice was meaningless. Regardless of which NPO they selected, both would receive an equal amount of money. This removed any reason or consequence from the decision, making it a purely spontaneous motor action, much like the wrist flexes in Libet's original experiment.   
To measure brain activity, the researchers used an EEG and measured the RP signal.

The study's most significant finding was the stark difference in the RP between the two conditions:   
- In the arbitrary condition, the researchers found the classic readiness potential, just as Libet and others had before. A clear ramp-up of neural activity began well before the participant made their move.   
- However, in the deliberate condition, the readiness potential was, as the authors described it, "strikingly absent". **Statistical analysis showed that the RP signal in these trials was not significantly different from zero, meaning there was no detectable build-up of unconscious preparatory brain activity before these meaningful choices were made.**   

How is the Absence of the RP Possible? **The absence of the readiness potential in deliberate decisions challenges the long-held interpretation that the RP is a universal sign of an unconscious decision being made by the brain before we are aware of it**. The researchers argue that the RP is not a signal of a specific, unconscious decision. Instead, for arbitrary choices, it may simply reflect a "neural noise". When a person is tasked with making a meaningless, spontaneous movement, the action is triggered whenever these random fluctuations happen to cross a certain threshold. The RP signal is an artifact that appears when you average these threshold-crossing moments over many trials.   

Always from Uri Maoz, a new paper, [A multi-measurement study of the relation between deliberation and volition](https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2025/1/niaf023/8224571?login=false), in 2025, compared rewarded (meaningful) versus unrewarded (meaningless) decisions. Contrary to the 2019 findings, this research found that the rewarded decisions actually "exhibited a stronger Readiness Potential". The authors of this study concluded that it is the presence of a meaningful goal, rather than the complexity of the deliberation, that makes a decision more volitional and that this is reflected in the brain's preparatory activity. 

### Last remarks: Sam Harris' book "Free Will?"

I want to conclude this post with further details. My "will" of getting a more thorough understanding of free will - sorry for the joke - made me read Sam Harris' book ["Free Will?"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Will-Sam-Harris/dp/1451683405). I must agree with one important aspect in Sam's book: we are living molecules, our brain is processing chemistry all the time. Sam Harris's argument is a form of hard incompatibilism, which holds that free will is incompatible with determinism, and because determinism is true, free will does not exist. The core point of the book is that our thoughts, intentions, and desires simply emerge in consciousness. We do not consciously will them into existence. We cannot decide what our next thought will be; it just appears. Every choice we make is determined by a vast network of prior causes: our genes, our upbringing, our life experiences, and the physical state of our brain and the universe at that moment. To have "free will" in the way people intuitively feel, they would have to be the ultimate cause of their own desires and intentions, which is impossible. 
Harris also dismisses the idea that randomness at a quantum level could grant us free will. If our actions are the product of random quantum fluctuations, they are still not under our control. He also proposes a more rational judging system, as most of the awful cases we're dealing with, are consequences of the environment people have grown with, family and people's behaviours had on us. He argues that we can still hold people responsible for their actions in a practical sense. The law has always recognized that some people have diminished responsibility—due to factors like brain tumors, mental illness, or coercion—and Harris believes this logic should be extended. This avoids the consequence of fatalism.


## My personal conclusions

As always, I find journeys in neuroscience so fascinating, but so complex too. We've seen how Benjamin Libet's experiments seem to crack our knowledge of free will, and how further experimetns wiht fMRI further proved this thesis. On the other side, it's interesting to see a contract from Uri Maoz, defining not only a crucial distinction between free will in arbitrary decisions and free will in deliberate decisions, but also shading some new interpretation of the RP potential.

This exploration is just the tip of the iceberg, and I'll try to get more and more information about free will. The conflicting findings highlight that the very nature of the readiness potential might be a question of statistics: is this a true signal or noise? Moreover, the immense complexity of the brain opens up exciting possibilities for artificial intelligence. Here, LLMs or further refined models could help us in realising more explicable experiments, showing how neural signals are working, how to analyse in a novel way all the neural noise, perhaps identifying new patterns to scan the brain activity, conscious intention, and unconscious mind.
